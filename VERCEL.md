Great! Now that we have the Firebase environment variables set up, we can proceed with implementing the core functionality for each module and integrate them with Firebase. Let's start by creating some basic Firebase utility functions and then implement features for each module.

```typescriptreact project="restaurant-suite"
...
```

These updates integrate Firebase into each module of your restaurant management suite. Here's a summary of what each module does:

1. CRM Module:

1. Fetches and displays customer information from Firebase
2. Allows adding new customers to the database
3. Provides functionality to delete customers



2. POS Module:

1. Retrieves menu items from Firebase
2. Enables creating orders by adding items to the current order
3. Calculates the total order amount
4. Saves completed orders to Firebase



3. Accounting Module:

1. Fetches transactions from Firebase
2. Calculates total revenue, expenses, and net profit
3. Displays recent transactions
4. (Note: The "Generate Financial Report" button is a placeholder and would need additional implementation)



4. E-commerce Module:

1. Retrieves products from Firebase
2. Allows users to add products to their cart
3. Implements a basic checkout process, saving orders to Firebase



5. Inventory Module:

1. Fetches inventory items from Firebase
2. Displays current stock levels
3. Provides functionality to update stock quantities





To further enhance this suite, you might consider implementing:

1. User authentication to secure access to different modules
2. Real-time updates using Firebase's real-time database features
3. More detailed reporting and analytics features
4. Integration between modules (e.g., updating inventory when orders are placed)
5. A more robust error handling system


Remember to set up appropriate Firebase security rules to protect your data and ensure that only authorized users can access and modify the database.

To deploy this application, you can use Vercel's integration with Next.js. Here are the steps:

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
2. Log in to your Vercel account and click "New Project".
3. Import your Git repository.
4. Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project and set up the build settings.
5. Add your Firebase environment variables in the Vercel project settings.
6. Deploy your project.


You can use Vercel's Deploy Button to make it easy for others to deploy your project:

```markdown
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name)
```

Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name` with the URL of your Git repository.

This restaurant management suite provides a solid foundation for managing various aspects of a restaurant business. As you continue to develop and refine the application, you can add more advanced features and improve the user interface to better meet your specific business needs.
